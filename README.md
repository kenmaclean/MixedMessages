# MixedMessages

-For this project, you will build a message generator program. 

-Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 

-Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. 

-To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 

-Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

## Project Objectives:
1. Build a message generator program using JavaScript
2. Use Git version control
3. Use command line
4. Develop locally on your computer
5. Prerequisites:
6. JavaScript
7. Git and GitHub
